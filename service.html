									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="me in Oregon" /></span>
									My name is Thu Nguyen, I'm currently a senior Applied Math major and Computer Science minor at Texas A&M University. 
									  Originally from Vietnam, I moved to Oregon, then Texas, several years ago with my family and have been staying here ever since. 
									  <br><br>
										I am pursuing Data Science and Data Analytics professionally, and currently interested in positions in those fields.
										I am proficient in <b>R and Python</b>, several frameworks used are <b>TensorFlow, and Pytorch</b>. I am familiar with <b>SQL</b>, and
										I can also code comfortably in <b>C++ and Java</b>. <br><br>
										In my freetime, I enjoy watching shows on Netlix and HBO, cooking, and hiking (especially during summertime in Oregon). 
										My favourite shows of all time are Game of Thrones and Friends.<br><br>

										Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”― George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones

										<li>Peer Mentor</li><span>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;I helped college freshmen and transfer assimilate to new environment at TAMU, especially during 
											this hard time.
										</span>
										<li>House Volunteer at Ronald MacDonalds House in Houston Medical Center</li>
										<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I helped checking families/guardians of NICU patients in and out, stock foods, check room's conditions,... to make sure their stays at 
											&nbsp;&nbsp;the hospital comfortable. It was a great experience, I was able to talk to many families, and get to know their stories. </span>
										<li>Back in Vietnam, I join different clubs and orgs to help with tutoring kids in mountainous areas and 
											raising funds for their school supplies as well as their personal expenses. </li>
